Do not afflict this version as the official\nversion.\nExample\nhttps://megamanhxh.github.io/ng-alt-snotify/\nFeatures\n\n9 types of toast notifications (async, confirm, prompt and more...)\nAbility to create toasts in different positions at the same time\nMany config options (icons, backdrop, timeout, position and much more)\nCustom fully controlled styling including animations\nRepository includes 3 different styles. So you can use on of them, or create your own.\nCallbacks\nCustom HTML\n4.3KB minified and gzipped\n\nLooking for an Vue.js 2 version? Here\n\nInstallation\nNPM 8\nnpm install ng-alt-snotify\nyarn\nyarn add ng-alt-snotify\nDocumentation and Examples\nDocumentation - hereExample application source - hereAuto-Documentation (Compodoc) - hereChange Log - here\nLicense\nMIT © artemsky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License\nCopyright (c) 2010-2017 Artem Kuznetsov\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
